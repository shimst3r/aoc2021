# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for the 2021 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021). Please do not expect perfectly polished solutions, most scripts are just hacked together and never touched again. Same holds for tests, as most of my solutions are developed using REPL Driven Development instead of Test Driven Development. :)
