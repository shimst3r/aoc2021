# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for the 2021 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021). Please do not expect perfectly polished solutions, most scripts are just hacked together and never touched again. Same holds for tests, as most of my solutions are developed using REPL Driven Development instead of Test Driven Development. :)

## Setup

If you want to reproduce my solutions using your own input (no guarantees my hacky code will work for your inputs!), dependencies are collected in a [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt):

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively you can use the project's [Devcontainer](./.devcontainer) setup in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## Contact

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shimst3r), where I'll most likely post stuff regarding my solutions.
